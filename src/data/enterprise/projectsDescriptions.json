Cette application a été conçue dans le but de compléter les solutions déjà existantes de l'entreprise en offrant un espace de stockage et d'accès aux documents, similaire à Dropbox, mais spécialement adapté aux besoins de l'entreprise. Ce projet a été réalisé en utilisant Vue.js, en particulier en exploitant l'option API de Vue.js. De plus, nous avons mis en place une API développée avec Node.js, qui a été complétée par une série d'extensions et de fonctionnalités pour répondre de manière optimale aux besoins spécifiques de l'entreprise."
